== Visual Guidelines
The goal of visual guidelines is to provide unified look and feel despite front-end development is split to multiple developers.

=== Page Sections
TBD - horizontal because of mobile devices with small screens

=== Forms
- Cancel button is on the left and has gray color
- Submit button is on right and has orange color

=== Item List
- Items are shown in <Table basic="very"> (from Semantic UI)
- Selection is done using <Checkbox /> (from Semantic UI)
- Actions (add, remove, edit ...) are above table
- Pagination is in the table footer on the left (for more details see <<pagination>>)

Example: see enumeration administration.
